- Take example tree references: cipr√©s, olivo, cerezo, palma, araucaria.

        a) set axiom - NO: rules enough.
        b) set more rules - YES: define a standard, initial, "Default" operation.
        c) set initial parameters that will influence the runtime - Perhaps.
        d) set parametrized operations - Possibly, to start ramification (or blossoming) from N operation
    - Define rendering parameters.
    - Define assets.
